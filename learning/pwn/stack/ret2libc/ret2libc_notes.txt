To find a libc address with PIE disabled, simply overwrite RIP with puts_plt and then put the callback function address and the puts got address after.

Check /2020/247ctf/pwn/non_exec_stack for more details.

If you are on 64 bit arch, use a pop_rdi gadget to pop puts got into rdi and return to puts plt, put your callback function AFTER puts plt.


16 byte alignment!
Make sure you place some ret gadgets before your other gadgets to align the stack by 16 bytes.
