Double free vulnerability to make malloc return the same pointer 3 times.

Freeing small 3 times did not work so I came up with a different plan.

First alloc small, then free it.

Now alloc medium with the same size.
This medium chunk will use the freed one, which is still referenced by small.

We now have a chunk that is pointed to from small and medium.

Do the same for large.
