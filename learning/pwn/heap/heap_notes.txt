<TO BE POILISHED LATER>


WRITING OVER THE TCACHE (VERY POWERFUL): UAF
The vulnerability is a use-after-free. After double-freeing, you can read the chunk data to leak a heap address. 
From this heap leak, you can compute the address of tcache and overwrite the forward pointer of the chunk so that you allocate a pointer pointing to the top of tcache. (This is my favorite trick, to date.)
Once you have control over tcache, it's basically game over.
Overwrite the tcache list size to 0x7 so that the next freed chunk is put on the smallbin; use this to leak a libc address.
Then overwrite tcache again to place __free_hook all over the tcache.
Next allocate a tcache chunk(which will actually be pointing to free_hook) and overwrite it with system.
Then allocate another chunk with "/bin/sh\0" and free it to get a shell.


DOUBLE FREE DETECTION BYPASS:
Freeing a different chunk in the middle of a double free will bypaass double free detection. 

LEAKING LIBC:
Bins (not tcache/fast) tend to have a libc address on them (for arena stuff).
By mallocing these chunks and reading them, you can leak libc addresses.


UNSORTED BIN ATTACK: overwrite the bk pointer of a freed unsorted chunk
This attack can be used to modify the global_max_fast in the heap to make the larger chunks look like fast bins, so we can perform some fast bin attacks.
Let's allocate two chunks (to prevent consolidation).
Free the first one and it will now be added to the unsorted bin.
Now, use some other vulnerability to overwrite the bk pointer of this freed chunk.
We will overwrite it to point to a fake chunk.
Now we will malloc a chunk of the same size of the freed chunk.
Through some magic that happens due to the way the unsorted bin works, the bk pointer of this fake chunk is now pointing to the freed chunk.
Since this freed chunk has a large address, we can use this to write to anywhere with a very large value.
For example, we can replace this fake chunk with global_max_fast to make large malloc requests only use the fastbin.



FASTBIN/TCACHE DUP INTO STACK (double free attack): Double free of a chunk in the fastbin or tcache
THIS EXPLOIT CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH TCACHE INSTEAD OF FASTBIN.

Exploit double free to get access to write address into stack.
Allocate 3 chunks of size 8.
Free the first, the second, and then the first again.

The fastbin list will now look like:

chunk_a -> chunk_b -> chunk_a -> 0x0

Pop chunk_a off of the fastbin list by allocating a chunk of 8.

chunk_a is now a writable freed chunk.
We can abuse this by overwriting the chunk_a ptr returned from malloc to point into a fake chunk in the stack with size 0x20
Now, after we malloc twice, the second malloc will return a pointer into the stack.


OVERWRITE FREE HOOK: pointer to free hook
Overwriting the free hook with system will make it so freeing a chunk with /bin/sh\0 as its data will spawn a shell.


TCACHE POISONING (or really anything): UAF (pointer to chunk still referenced after being freed)
THIS CAN BE DONE BY ONLY USING ONE CHUNK, however:
After the patch https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=77dc0d8643aa99c92bf671352b0a8adde705896f,
We have to create and free one more chunk for padding before fd pointer hijacking.

This is one of the coolest and simplest tricks in heap exploitation.
Lets start by mallocing and freeing 2 chunks.
They should now be placed in a bin list like this:
chunk_ptr_2 -> chunk_ptr_1 -> 0x0
Seems fine, right?

Our chunk_2 data should be looking kind of like this:
0x00000000 0x00000050
0x555f0fe9 0x00000000  <- fd and bk pointers
0x41414141 0x41414141  <- data was not zeroed out

Our chunk_1 data should be looking kind of like this:
0x00000000 0x00000050
0x00000000 0x555f0f99  <- fd and bk pointers
0x41414141 0x41414141  <- data was not zeroed out

Well, what happens if this program still stores the pointer to these chunks after freeing them (UAF).
Well, this gives us access to overwriting the fd and bk pointers, as they are still referenced.
Let's overwrite the fd pointer of chunk_ptr_2 with the libc address for MALLOC_HOOK.

Our chunk_2 data should be looking kind of like this:
0x00000000 0x00000050
0x7f79a7fe 0x00000000  <- fd(pointing to MALLOC_HOOK) and bk pointers
0x41414141 0x41414141  <- data was not zeroed out

Our bin list will now look like this:
chunk_ptr_2 -> MALLOC_HOOK -> 0x0

Uh Oh! The POINTER for MALLOC_HOOK is now on the bin list, when we allocate 2 new chunks, the second will give a pointer into the CODE for MALLOC_HOOK rather than a heap chunk.
Let's try mallocing twice!

Our bin list after the first malloc:
MALLOC_HOOK -> 0x0

Our bin list after the second malloc:
0x0

We now have a pointer into the CODE for MALLOC_HOOK and can edit it (the same as editing data in a heap chunk).
If we edit this "chunk", which is really assembly instructions for MALLOC_HOOK, we can make MALLOC_HOOK instead run a ROP gadget that pops a shell.

Voila, we now have access to a shell all from a simple mistake in forgetting to dereference chunk pointers!



TCACHE NOTES:
The tcache is a bin list holding up to 7 chunks.
Once it is filled up, freed chunks will continue to be placed in the unsorted bin.



DOUBLE FREE NOTES:
Freeing a chunk twice (double free) will make its fd point to itself.
This is useful if you want to leak heap addresses.

USE AFTER FREE IS DANGEROUS AND HERE IS WHY:
Lets say we make a malloc call with size 0x300 and free it.
Now lets make several more allocations and free every other one (to prevent chunks from consolidating).
Now lets use our original malloc pointer to edit the chunk.
We can now edit the freed chunk, which contains the other allocations.
What now? We can edit those freed allocations to change their fd and bk pointers, and then once we unlink them, we have arbitrary write.\
(You can also overwrite your own fd pointer because it is in the data section that is writable.)



HOW TO BYPASS UNLINK CHECKS SAFELY:
Set fake chunk fd and bk pointers to point to fake chunk, so fake chunk -> fd -> bk == fake chunk (and vice versa)



IMPORTANT:
It is sometimes useful to malloc another chunk after the one you want to exploit. This is useful so that the compromised chunk wont consolidate with the wilderness after being freed.



THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT (UNSAFE UNLINK): heap chunk overflow
We assume that we have an overflow in chunk0 so that we can freely change chunk1 metadata.
We shrink the size of chunk0 (saved as 'previous_size' in chunk1) so that free will think that chunk0 starts where we placed our fake chunk.



https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/house_of_spirit.html
House of Spirit exploit: overwrite chunk pointer
Create fake chunk anywhere
Somehow overwrite pointer of a real chunk to point to fake chunk
Free pointer of the real chunk(which actually points to the fake chunk now)
Wait for program to malloc the freed fake chunk
The pointer can now point to anywhere in memory and can write to that place
Profit??? (If the pointer points to the stack, u can overwrite eip by changing the data that is pointed to)



UNSAFE UNLINK: heap chunk overflow
so the basic idea is
get control of a chunk
make it so u forge a fake chunk in the data of that chunk
set the bd and fd pointers to something of use
and wait for the chunk after to be freed
it will then notice that the fake chunk is free
and will unlink that chunk
giving u arbitrary write
